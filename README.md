### Business Impact and Insights
1. Top Category Focus
Toys contribute 74.83% of total revenue, dominating all other categories. Music, Furniture Mattress, and Fashion Sport underperform, signaling the product team to rework or phase them out.

2. High Value States
SÃ£o Paulo alone drives 42.29% of total orders, followed by Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Marketing should prioritize these for campaigns and promotions.

3. Growth Opportunity Regions
Roraima has the lowest order volume (12 orders) but highest revenue per order at $280, followed by Amazonas and Acre, each with under 52 orders but strong revenue per order.
These states are highly profitable yet underutilized. Targeted local ads or discount strategies can boost demand in these areas.

4. Seasonal Trends
Peak revenue occurred in Nov 2017 at $1.3M, revealing strong seasonal patterns. Plan campaigns and product launches around these months.

5. Order Approval Efficiency
With 99.9% of orders approved and just 7 unapproved, workflows are efficient. Still, edge cases in SÃ£o Paulo (3 orders), Rio De Janeiro (2), Rio Grande Do Sul(1) and Massachusetts(1) can be reviewed.

6. Top 10 States = 89% of Business
These states account for 89.5% of orders and 88.5% of revenue. Focus sales, logistics, and marketing efforts here to maximize ROI.
